{/* ## Summary
The branding project for Bounce Back Digital, parent company of Bounce Back Coin, focused on building a cohesive identity that represented the company‚Äôs position as both a digital agency and fintech startup. The process began with research into two design directions: one light-hearted and minimalist with stroke outlines, and another more professional with gradients, wireframes, and bold elements. After iterations and refinements, the second direction was chosen and adjusted to a blue-toned palette, resulting in a modern and professional visual identity aligned with the company‚Äôs vision.

Alongside the finalized branding, I created a full set of marketing and communication assets to support the company‚Äôs presence across digital and physical channels. These included the finalized logomark, website, social media carousels, business cards, print materials, and presentation slides. Together, these deliverables established a consistent brand language that could scale across different mediums and effectively showcase Bounce Back Digital‚Äôs services.

## ‚ú® Introduction

Welcome to the Bounce Back Coin Branding Design Showcase. Bounce Back Coin is a learning platform that lets users earn cryptocurrency by participating in educational activities. Our goal is to make learning fun and rewarding.

As the designer for Bounce Back Coin, I created the logo and branding guidelines to ensure a consistent look and feel. I also designed the marketing website.

## üîç Research and Analysis

The logo design process began with brainstorming concepts related to bouncing and growth, as seen in the sketches exploring shapes and movements. These ideas were refined into a cohesive design that symbolizes learning and reward, encapsulating the essence of Bounce Back Coin.

## üé® Final Style Guide

The team decided to move forward with the second design direction, selecting the "B" logo mark for its simplicity and relevance. Building on this choice, I developed a comprehensive style guide to establish a strong foundation for the brand's visual identity.

### Addition of Patterns

To honor the heritage of the founders, I incorporated cultural patterns inspired by African and Caribbean traditions into the design, subtly weaving a rich tapestry of heritage into the brand's visual identity. I carefully melded these cultural elements with geometric shapes, ensuring a harmonious blend that enhances the existing design aesthetic.
