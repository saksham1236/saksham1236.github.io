## Summary
The branding project for Bounce Back Digital, parent company of Bounce Back Coin, focused on building a cohesive identity that represented the company’s position as both a digital agency and fintech startup. The process began with research into two design directions: one light-hearted and minimalist with stroke outlines, and another more professional with gradients, wireframes, and bold elements. After iterations and refinements, the second direction was chosen and adjusted to a blue-toned palette, resulting in a modern and professional visual identity aligned with the company’s vision.

Alongside the finalized branding, I created a full set of marketing and communication assets to support the company’s presence across digital and physical channels. These included the finalized logomark, website, social media carousels, business cards, print materials, and presentation slides. Together, these deliverables established a consistent brand language that could scale across different mediums and effectively showcase Bounce Back Digital’s services.
