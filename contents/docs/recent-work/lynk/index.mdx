## Overview
Lynk is a platform designed to reduce social isolation among young adults by connecting them to local communities and events. Users can browse groups, join activities, and host events. Through three rounds of testing, we refined navigation, activity creation, COVID-safety measures, and payment flows. The final product simplified access to meaningful connections and promoted well-being.

## The Problem

</Note>
### Social Isolation Among Young Adults
Young adults moving to a new city often experience loneliness and disconnection. COVID-19 worsened this by limiting in-person interactions, causing stress and reducing motivation.

<span className = "text-xs italic">We asked university students and working professionals to illustrate their experiences with social isolation by contributing to online Google Boards, helping us capture their thoughts and emotions visually.</span>

### Gaps in Existing Platforms
Platforms like Meetup or Eventbrite were limited in supporting emotional readiness and accessibility. Users needed a platform that was easy to navigate, encouraged social interaction, and prioritized safety and well-being.

## Research & Insights
To understand the needs of young adults experiencing social isolation—especially those moving to new cities for school or work—we combined first-hand experiences with user interviews and surveys. Our goal was to uncover what helps individuals feel supported, connected, and motivated to participate in community activities.
<CardGrid className="lg:!grid-cols-2">
<Note title = "Target Audience" className = "text-xl text-neutral-invert leading-relaxed bg-card border">
Our focus was on Ontario-based young adults ages 20–28 who are relocating to new environments, including both graduates and non-graduates. These users often face challenges like stress, loneliness, and difficulty establishing routines while seeking meaningful social connections.
</Note>
<Note title = "Competitive Landscape" className = "text-xl text-neutral-invert leading-relaxed bg-card border">
We analyzed platforms like **Meetup, Eventbrite, Citysocializer, Nextdoor, Wine For The People, and Clozette.** While these platforms support social connections and events, they lack focus on emotional wellness, mental health, and accessibility.

  The person is looking for opportunities to grow. They are willing to take most opportunities that offer a path for personal development. They regularly venture out to new place in search of opportunities like better working conditions, better salary, better living standards etc.

  Their motivation generally comes from living in either sub-par conditions and want to grow out of it or have connections to other people who grew out of those kind conditions and want to follow their lead.

  They are often independent when it comes to living and are financially stable conditions. They also show occasional interests in passions with main focus on activities that can help them grow.

### User Journey
We first conducted a Kano model survey to determine which features were most valued by users. Using these insights, we then developed a user journey informed by requirements highlighted during a UX heuristics evaluation.

## Design Process

### Iteration 1 – Foundation
We built the initial foundation through market research, user flow mapping, and low-fidelity prototypes for both web and mobile. Usability testing with users aged 18–23 using unregulated Lo-Fi Figma mockups and a short feedback form showed that the overall experience felt dense and needed refinement.

#### Feedback
- Too much information on screen made the design feel overwhelming.  
- Buttons were too small, and spacing was inconsistent.  
- The interface needed a cleaner, more modern look.  
- Users wanted clearer emphasis on safety and COVID-related measures.

  <ImageViewer imageUrl="/images/lynk/wireframe-mobile-iteration-1.png" alt="Prototype for Iteration 1" title="Wireframe — mobile"/>
</CarouselView>

### Iteration 2 – Mid-Fidelity & Branding

In this iteration, we focused on defining the user persona and building a stronger brand identity while refining the product into a mid-fidelity prototype. An attendee list feature was added to help users gauge crowd size and maintain comfort during COVID-19, with optional anonymity for participants. Unregulated usability testing was conducted a short survey like the first iteration, where users were asked to sign up and create an activity, providing insights for further improvements.

#### Feedback

- Users liked the visual improvements but still found the interface overwhelming.  
- Button hierarchy and differentiation between actions needed more clarity.   
- Text clarity and phrasing needed improvement to reduce confusion. 
- Suggested adding interest-based categories for activities and an onboarding tour

</CarouselView>
</div>

### Iteration 3 – Activity Creation
This iteration focused on improving the usability of key flows, especially creating an activity. A high-fidelity desktop prototype was tested with users completing account creation, exploring activities, and creating events. The activity creation flow was split into multiple pages for clarity, and overall interactions were refined based on observed behavior.

#### Feedback

- Users found the activity creation process confusing and the steps too many.  
- Lack of guidance, unclear labels, and horizontal scrolling disrupted flow.  
- Suggested adding progress indicators, tooltips, and brief explanations for form sections.  
- Navigation and button differentiation needed improvement.  
- Payment confirmation should use a pop-up.

  <ImageViewer imageUrl="/images/lynk/tooltip-after.png" alt="Tag Tooltip" title="Tag tooltip"/>
</CarouselView>

### Final MVP
For the final prototype, key improvements were made to enhance navigation and usability. The navbar was changed from vertical to horizontal with visible labels for clarity. Breadcrumbs and a labeled back button were added to the activity creation flow to indicate progress and simplify navigation. A payment confirmation pop-up was implemented, and tooltips were added to tags for better understanding.

#### Updated Navigation Bar

</div>

## Key Learnings

- **End-to-end delivery:** Taking a product from concept to MVP highlighted the importance of prioritization and iteration.

- **Clarity through design:** Step-by-step guidance, visual cues, and clear layouts improved user confidence.

- **Safety & trust:** Features like anonymous participation and attendee lists built trust, particularly during COVID-19.
