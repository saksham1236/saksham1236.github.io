## üìù Summary
Lynk was a social platform designed to reduce isolation among young adults by making it easier to connect with local communities, organize activities, and attend events. The project was based on the insight that individuals entering new environments ‚Äî whether school, work, or a new city ‚Äî often struggled to build meaningful connections, which negatively affected their mental and physical health.

The app‚Äôs main features allowed users to create or join communities, host events, and participate in activities that matched their interests. Users could browse local groups, view attendee lists before committing, and take part in activities that encouraged healthier routines.

The product went through three rounds of usability testing and iterative refinement. Updates included simplifying event creation flows, adding breadcrumbs and horizontal navigation, incorporating COVID-safety considerations, refining the visual hierarchy, and implementing payment and confirmation pop-ups to reduce uncertainty.

By its final iteration, Lynk enabled users to engage with local communities in a structured and supportive way, making it easier to attend events and form connections in new environments.

## üß© The Problem

  <div>
    ### Social Isolation Among Young Adults
      When young adults move to a new city for work or school, they often leave behind familiar routines, friends, and support networks. This sudden change can make them feel disconnected and lonely, even if they are surrounded by people. The COVID-19 pandemic further intensified this isolation, limiting opportunities for in-person social interactions and creating additional barriers to meeting new people. Over time, this combination of relocation and pandemic-related restrictions can lead to stress, anxiety, and decreased motivation to engage in daily activities, affecting both mental and physical health.

### Key Gaps in Existing Platforms
While platforms like Meetup, Eventbrite, and Nextdoor help users connect in different ways, they don‚Äôt fully address the emotional readiness, mental health, and accessibility needs of young adults facing social isolation. This revealed a clear gap: users need a platform that reduces social friction, supports emotional well-being, and encourages a gentle return to social life, especially after long periods of isolation.

## üöÄ The Solution
### Building a Safe and Supportive Platform
To tackle the challenges of social isolation, Lynk was designed as an event organizing platform that fosters real-world connections. The focus was on creating low-pressure, emotionally supportive experiences, enabling users to safely participate in local activities while rebuilding routines and forming new social bonds. Wellness-oriented, outdoor, and group activities were prioritized to promote both mental and physical health, with features like activity categorization, attendee lists, and optional anonymity giving users control over their social interactions.

### The Approach
Lynk‚Äôs design followed an iterative, user-centered process to support young adults facing social isolation. We began with low-fidelity prototypes to map the app‚Äôs structure. Early testing showed users were overwhelmed by too much information and needed clearer guidance, highlighting the need for a minimalistic and intuitive design.

In the second iteration, we developed mid-fidelity prototypes with defined branding and a clear user flow for joining activities. Features like an attendee list addressed COVID-19 concerns, while user feedback guided improvements to button design, layout, and navigation clarity.

The final iteration focused on refining the activity creation process. Moderated testing revealed confusion over form steps and horizontal scrolling. We solved this by splitting flows into multiple pages, adding breadcrumbs, tooltips, and vertical layouts, and updating the navbar and payment pop-up for clarity.

These iterations resulted in a platform that facilitates local connections while supporting emotional well-being and easing users back into social engagement.
