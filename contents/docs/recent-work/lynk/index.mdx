## Overview
Lynk is a platform designed to reduce social isolation among young adults by connecting them to local communities and events. Users can browse groups, join activities, and host events. Through three rounds of testing, we refined navigation, activity creation, COVID-safety measures, and payment flows. The final product simplified access to meaningful connections and promoted well-being.

## The Problem

</Note>
### Social Isolation Among Young Adults
Young adults moving to a new city often experience loneliness and disconnection. COVID-19 worsened this by limiting in-person interactions, causing stress and reducing motivation.

<span className = "text-xs italic">We asked university students and working professionals to illustrate their experiences with social isolation by contributing to online Google Boards, helping us capture their thoughts and emotions visually.</span>

### Gaps in Existing Platforms
Platforms like Meetup or Eventbrite were limited in supporting emotional readiness and accessibility. Users needed a platform that was easy to navigate, encouraged social interaction, and prioritized safety and well-being.

## Research & Insights
To understand the needs of young adults experiencing social isolation—especially those moving to new cities for school or work—we combined first-hand experiences with user interviews and surveys. Our goal was to uncover what helps individuals feel supported, connected, and motivated to participate in community activities.
<CardGrid className="lg:!grid-cols-2">
<Note title = "Target Audience" className = "text-xl text-neutral-invert leading-relaxed bg-card border">
Our focus was on Ontario-based young adults ages 20–28 who are relocating to new environments, including both graduates and non-graduates. These users often face challenges like stress, loneliness, and difficulty establishing routines while seeking meaningful social connections.
</Note>
<Note title = "Competitive Landscape" className = "text-xl text-neutral-invert leading-relaxed bg-card border">
We analyzed platforms like **Meetup, Eventbrite, Citysocializer, Nextdoor, Wine For The People, and Clozette.** While these platforms support social connections and events, they lack focus on emotional wellness, mental health, and accessibility.

  The person is looking for opportunities to grow. They are willing to take most opportunities that offer a path for personal development. They regularly venture out to new place in search of opportunities like better working conditions, better salary, better living standards etc.

  Their motivation generally comes from living in either sub-par conditions and want to grow out of it or have connections to other people who grew out of those kind conditions and want to follow their lead.

  They are often independent when it comes to living and are financially stable conditions. They also show occasional interests in passions with main focus on activities that can help them grow.

### User Journey
We first conducted a Kano model survey to determine which features were most valued by users. Using these insights, we then developed a user journey informed by requirements highlighted during a UX heuristics evaluation.

## Design Process

### Iteration 1 – Foundation
 - Developed low-fidelity wireframes to map core flows.
 - Early testing revealed users felt overwhelmed; navigation needed simplification.

  <ImageViewer imageUrl="/images/lynk/wireframe-mobile-iteration-1.png" alt="Prototype for Iteration 1" title="Wireframe — mobile"/>
</CarouselView>

### Iteration 2 – Mid-Fidelity & Branding
- Introduced branding, clearer flows, and attendee lists.
- Refined buttons, layout, and navigation based on feedback.
- Addressed COVID-19 safety concerns in activity participation.

### Iteration 3 – Activity Creation
- Redesigned the activity creation form with multi-step layout

</CarouselView>

### Final MVP
