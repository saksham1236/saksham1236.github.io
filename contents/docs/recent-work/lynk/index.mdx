## üìù Summary
Lynk was a social platform designed to reduce isolation among young adults by making it easier to connect with local communities, organize activities, and attend events. The project was based on the insight that individuals entering new environments ‚Äî whether school, work, or a new city ‚Äî often struggled to build meaningful connections, which negatively affected their mental and physical health.

The app‚Äôs main features allowed users to create or join communities, host events, and participate in activities that matched their interests. Users could browse local groups, view attendee lists before committing, and take part in activities that encouraged healthier routines.

The product went through three rounds of usability testing and iterative refinement. Updates included simplifying event creation flows, adding breadcrumbs and horizontal navigation, incorporating COVID-safety considerations, refining the visual hierarchy, and implementing payment and confirmation pop-ups to reduce uncertainty.

By its final iteration, Lynk enabled users to engage with local communities in a structured and supportive way, making it easier to attend events and form connections in new environments.

## üß© The Problem
<CardGrid className = "lg:!grid-cols-2 gap-16 prose-p:!mb-0 prose-headings:!mt-0">
  <div>
    ### Social Isolation Among Young Adults
      When young adults move to a new city for work or school, they often leave behind familiar routines, friends, and support networks. This sudden change can make them feel disconnected and lonely, even if they are surrounded by people. The COVID-19 pandemic further intensified this isolation, limiting opportunities for in-person social interactions and creating additional barriers to meeting new people. Over time, this combination of relocation and pandemic-related restrictions can lead to stress, anxiety, and decreased motivation to engage in daily activities, affecting both mental and physical health.

### Key Gaps in Existing Platforms
While platforms like Meetup, Eventbrite, and Nextdoor help users connect in different ways, they don‚Äôt fully address the emotional readiness, mental health, and accessibility needs of young adults facing social isolation. This revealed a clear gap: users need a platform that reduces social friction, supports emotional well-being, and encourages a gentle return to social life, especially after long periods of isolation.

## üöÄ The Solution
### Building a Safe and Supportive Platform
To tackle the challenges of social isolation, Lynk was designed as an event organizing platform that fosters real-world connections. The focus was on creating low-pressure, emotionally supportive experiences, enabling users to safely participate in local activities while rebuilding routines and forming new social bonds. Wellness-oriented, outdoor, and group activities were prioritized to promote both mental and physical health, with features like activity categorization, attendee lists, and optional anonymity giving users control over their social interactions.

### The Approach
Lynk‚Äôs design followed an iterative, three-iteration process, improving with feedback from each stage to create a platform that supports social connections and emotional well-being.

<CardGrid className = "!grid-cols-1 gap-16 prose-p:!mb-0 prose-headings:!mt-0 items-center py-8">
  <div>
    ### The Foundation
      We began with low-fidelity prototypes to map the app‚Äôs core structure. Early testing revealed that users were overwhelmed by too much information and needed clearer guidance to navigate and join activities.

</CardGrid>
<div className='py-8'>
<CardGrid className = "lg:!grid-cols-2 gap-16 prose-p:!mb-0 prose-headings:!mt-0 items-center py-8">
  <div>
    ### Building the Community: Mid-Fidelity and Branding
      In the second iteration, we developed mid-fidelity prototypes with defined branding and a clear user flow for joining activities. Features like an attendee list addressed COVID-19 safety concerns, while user feedback guided improvements to button design, layout, and navigation clarity.

  <div>
    ### Creating and Participating: Improving the Activity Creation Process
      The third iteration focused on refining the activity creation process. Moderated testing revealed confusion over form steps and horizontal scrolling. We addressed this by splitting flows into multiple pages, adding breadcrumbs, tooltips, and vertical layouts, and updating the navbar and payment pop-up.

    ### Final Steps: Preparing for MVP
      In the final iteration, we implemented last refinements before the MVP release. This included updating the navbar layout to horizontal, adding breadcrumbs for multi-step flows, clarifying tooltips and tag information, and improving the payment confirmation pop-up.

## Final Product and Key Learnings
This was my second experience taking a product design idea from a problem statement to a business concept and then to an MVP. It was a valuable opportunity to strengthen my design skills, learn how to prioritize features, and refine user flows based on real feedback. Here is what I learned.

- **Bringing it all together:** The final prototype brought together all aspects of the platform ‚Äî joining and creating activities, attendee lists, tooltips, breadcrumbs, payment pop-ups, and the hero screen. Iteratively refining each element while responding to user feedback taught me how to prioritize features, decide what could be deferred, and continuously improve usability and support for emotional well-being.

- **Designing for clarity:** Early testing revealed that too much information and unclear navigation overwhelmed users. This experience reinforced the importance of step-by-step guidance, intuitive layouts, and clear visual cues to help users confidently engage with the platform.

- **Safety and trust:** Features like anonymous participation and attendee lists were essential for user comfort, particularly during COVID-19. Incorporating these considerations taught me how design decisions impact user trust and emotional well-being.
