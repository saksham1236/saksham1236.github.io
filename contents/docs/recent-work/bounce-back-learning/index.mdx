## üìù Summary
Bounce Back Coin Learning Platform was a learning management system (LMS) that aimed to combine education with cryptocurrency incentives. The platform allowed users to earn crypto by watching educational videos and completing quizzes, encouraging continued learning through direct rewards. It offered a range of content, focusing on STEM subjects such as coding, mathematics, and science, as well as language learning.

The system included course-specific discussion threads to support peer interaction and community learning. Users could also manage their earned crypto through a built-in wallet dashboard. Although the startup is now defunct, the platform represented an experimental approach to blending decentralized finance and education.

## üß© The Problem
### A Novelty Product
The challenge was to design a complex learning system that combined education, cryptocurrency, and game-like elements into a single experience that felt fun, rewarding, and motivating.
### Bringing Education, Crypto, and Play under One App
Most LMS platforms only deliver content, but Bounce Back aimed to create an ecosystem where learning progress translated directly into tangible rewards and community interaction. This meant going far beyond courses ‚Äî integrating a wallet, reward mechanisms, gamified quizzes, and peer discussions, all under one consistent design system that could scale as the product grew.

## üöÄ The Solution
### What was present
While I was developing the branding, the co-founders had already started sketching their own ideas, which helped me understand their vision.

### First Steps - The Bounce Back Design System
To tackle the complexity of the platform, I began by creating what was less a design system and more a component library that could be reused anywhere in the app. It started with simple primitives like buttons, cards, text fields, and forms, but then expanded to include more advanced elements such as charts, replies, audio player, toolbars, and even a code editor.

### Initial Designs
"In the initial design phases, there was little time for exploration, but here‚Äôs a snippet from the early idea for the dashboard. I wish I had the time to document the rest of the process. Funny enough, most of the feedback was just 'a certain feature is missing' or 'make it nicer.' (I even paid for Figma Professional to get this screenshot üò©)"

### Final Product and Learnings
The final product brought together all parts of the platform into a single experience ‚Äî courses, quizzes, rewards, wallet management, and peer-to-peer discussions. Working alongside another designer while managing other initiatives, delivering an MVP was a race against time. This experience taught me how to prioritize features effectively and decide what to defer under tight deadlines.
- **A Design System? A Component Library?** As I built more and collaborated with developers, it became clearer ‚Äî this was a component library with a style guide. A true design system would have included more thorough documentation, better reasoning for decisions, and would have made the developer‚Äôs job easier, reducing the need for assumptions about how or where to use a component.
- **Designing for others.** This was my first time building a system where I had to think beyond my own use of components ‚Äî considering how other designers would use them and how the system would need to scale as the project‚Äôs scope grew. I also made sure to keep components flexible enough so other designers could adapt them to their unique use cases without drifting too far from the brand.
- **Balance is key.** It was challenging to combine education, finance, and game-like mechanics without overwhelming the user. Clear navigation and a consistent visual style helped keep things approachable.
- **Collaboration matters.** The co-founders‚Äô early sketches provided direction, and working closely with them helped translate their vision into a working design system. I also had to think about design documentation and developer handoff to make sure the system could be implemented smoothly.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

- **Learn-to-Earn Crypto Flow:** I wanted to research and create the complete user journey for earning crypto through learning, ensuring a clear and engaging experience.
- **Enhanced Code Editor:** Planned to add advanced features such as AI-assisted coding, autocompletion, and collaborative editing.
- **Educator Tools:** Aimed to develop a more comprehensive flow for educators to create, manage, and track educational materials efficiently.
- **Onboarding for crypto beginners:** Worked on simplifying the wallet and reward flows to make them more approachable for users new to cryptocurrency.
- **More gamification:** Intended to add features like leaderboards, streaks, badges, or challenges to increase engagement.
