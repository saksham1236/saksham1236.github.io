## ‚ú® Introduction
Bounce Back Coin Learning Platform was a learning management system (LMS) that aimed to combine education with cryptocurrency incentives. The platform allowed users to earn crypto by watching educational videos and completing quizzes, encouraging continued learning through direct rewards. It offered a range of content, focusing on STEM subjects such as coding, mathematics, and science, as well as language learning.

The system included course-specific discussion threads to support peer interaction and community learning. Users could also manage their earned crypto through a built-in wallet dashboard. Although the startup is now defunct, the platform represented an experimental approach to blending decentralized finance and education.
