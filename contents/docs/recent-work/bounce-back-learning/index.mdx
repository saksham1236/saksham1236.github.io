## Overview
Bounce Back Learning was a learning platform where users could earn cryptocurrency by completing educational content such as videos and quizzes. Beyond courses, the platform integrated a wallet, rewards, and discussion boards, blending learning with finance and social interaction. The final product tied together all these elements into a single experience.

## The Problem

</Note>

### A Novelty Product
Most LMS platforms focus only on delivering content. Bounce Back aimed to create an ecosystem where learning progress translated directly into tangible crypto rewards and community interaction.

### Complexity of Scope
The challenge was not just courses, but also wallet management, gamified quizzes, peer messaging, and reward flows — all needing to work under one consistent system.

## About our Users
The founders conducted thorough marketing research and identified K-12 education as the platform’s target market. Based on this research, I defined two primary user personas to guide the product design: one for students and one for educators, ensuring the platform met the needs of both groups effectively.

        <span className='italic text-sm'>“Goddess of wisdom, learning, and strategy.”</span>

        Students were the core users. They engaged with courses, quizzes, and peer discussions, motivated by direct crypto rewards for their progress. They needed simple navigation, clear learning flows, and a wallet experience that felt approachable even for crypto beginners.

        <span className='italic text-sm'>“Centaur of wisdom, teaching, and mentorship.”</span>

        Educators needed tools to create and manage content while tracking student progress. Their priorities were efficiency, clarity, and reliable systems for delivering both knowledge and rewards. The platform had to give them flexibility without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Design Process

### Brainstorming & Early Designs
I brainstormed ideas with the co-founders to align on the scope of the platform — how courses, rewards, discussions, and wallet features could all work together. Here are some of the early concepts we explored:

    <ImageViewer imageUrl="/images/bb-learning/starter-05.png" alt="Bounce Back Learning - Initial Ideas" />
</CarouselView>

As part of this process, I mapped out the platform structure to capture the relationships between learning, rewards, and community features.

From there, I moved into early dashboard designs to bring these ideas together in one place. Most feedback at this stage focused on missing features or requests to refine the interface.

### Building the System
To manage complexity, I created a reusable component library. Starting with basics like buttons and cards, it grew to include charts, reply threads, audio players, toolbars, and even a code editor.

## Final MVP and Learnings
The final product brought together all parts of the platform into a single experience — courses, quizzes, rewards, wallet management, and peer-to-peer discussions. Working alongside another designer while managing other initiatives, delivering an MVP was a race against time. This experience taught me how to prioritize features effectively and decide what to defer under tight deadlines.
- **A Design System? A Component Library?** As I built more and collaborated with developers, it became clearer — this was a component library with a style guide. A true design system would have included more thorough documentation, better reasoning for decisions, and would have made the developer’s job easier, reducing the need for assumptions about how or where to use a component.
- **Designing for collaboration.** This was my first time building a system where I had to think beyond my own use of components — considering how other designers would use them and how the system would need to scale as the project’s scope grew. The co-founders’ early sketches provided direction, and working closely with them helped translate their vision into a usable system. I also had to think about design documentation and developer handoff, making sure the components were flexible enough for different use cases but still consistent with the brand.
- **Balance is key.** It was challenging to combine education, finance, and game-like mechanics without overwhelming the user. Clear navigation and a consistent visual style helped keep things approachable.
