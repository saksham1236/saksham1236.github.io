## üìù Summary
Bounce Back Coin Learning Platform was a learning management system (LMS) that aimed to combine education with cryptocurrency incentives. The platform allowed users to earn crypto by watching educational videos and completing quizzes, encouraging continued learning through direct rewards. It offered a range of content, focusing on STEM subjects such as coding, mathematics, and science, as well as language learning.

The system included course-specific discussion threads to support peer interaction and community learning. Users could also manage their earned crypto through a built-in wallet dashboard. Although the startup is now defunct, the platform represented an experimental approach to blending decentralized finance and education.

## üß© The Problem
### A Novelty Product
The challenge was to design a complex learning system that combined education, cryptocurrency, and game-like elements into a single experience that felt fun, rewarding, and motivating.
### Bringing Education, Crypto, and Play under One App
Most LMS platforms only deliver content, but Bounce Back aimed to create an ecosystem where learning progress translated directly into tangible rewards and community interaction. This meant going far beyond courses ‚Äî integrating a wallet, reward mechanisms, gamified quizzes, and peer discussions, all under one consistent design system that could scale as the product grew.

## üöÄ The Solution
### What was present
While I was developing the branding, the co-founders had already started sketching their own ideas, which helped me understand their vision.
