I designed the logo, branding guidelines, and website.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Bounce Back Coin Branding Design Showcase. Bounce Back Coin is a learning platform that lets users earn cryptocurrency by participating in educational activities. Our goal is to make learning fun and rewarding.\n\nAs the designer for Bounce Back Coin, I created the logo and branding guidelines to ensure a consistent look and feel. I also designed the marketing website.\n\n## Research and Analysis\n\nThe logo design process began with brainstorming concepts related to bouncing and growth, as seen in the sketches exploring shapes and movements. These ideas were refined into a cohesive design that symbolizes learning and reward, encapsulating the essence of Bounce Back Coin.\n\n### Logo Mark Ideas\n\n![Sketches](image-url)\n\n### Direction #1 - Playful Gradients, minimalist while being engaging.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #2 - Pure minimalist, simple with flat colors.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Mood Board\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n### Direction #3 - Mix of both styles.\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Style Scape\" />\n\n## Final Style Guide\n\nThe team decided to move forward with the second design direction, selecting the \"B\" logo mark for its simplicity and relevance. Building on this choice, I developed a comprehensive style guide to establish a strong foundation for the brand's visual identity.\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Final Style Guide\" />\n\n## Website Design Mockup\n\n### Desktop Design\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Desktop Design\" />\n\n### Mobile Design\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Mobile Design\" />\n\n## Some Social Media Assets\n\n### Instagram Post Carousel\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Instagram Carousel\" />\n\n### Addition of Patterns\n\nTo honor the heritage of the founders, I incorporated cultural patterns inspired by African and Caribbean traditions into the design, subtly weaving a rich tapestry of heritage into the brand's visual identity. I carefully melded these cultural elements with geometric shapes, ensuring a harmonious blend that enhances the existing design aesthetic.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mood Board - Cultural Patterns</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Cultural Patterns\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mood Board - Geometric Patterns</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    <img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Geometric Patterns\" />\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Final Patterns\" />\n\n### Retractable Banner\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Retractable Banner\" />\n\n### Bounce Back Coin Animation\n\nAnimation illustrating the process of earning Bounce Back cryptocurrency upon completion of learning materials, crafted using Blender.\n\n<img src=\"image-url\" alt=\"Animation\" />\n",

I designed the logo, branding guidelines, and website.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWelcome to the Bounce Back Coin Branding Design Showcase. Bounce Back Coin is a learning platform that lets users earn cryptocurrency by participating in educational activities. Our goal is to make learning fun and rewarding.\n\nAs the designer for Bounce Back Coin, I created the logo and branding guidelines to ensure a consistent look and feel. I also designed the marketing website.\n\n## Research and Analysis\n\nThe logo design process began with brainstorming concepts related to bouncing and growth, as seen in the sketches exploring shapes and movements. These ideas were refined into a cohesive design that symbolizes learning and reward, encapsulating the essence of Bounce Back Coin.\n\n### Logo Mark Ideas\n\n![Sketches](/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas.png)\r\n![Sketches](/images/bb-coin-branding/logo-mark-ideas-2.png)\n\n### Direction #1 - Playful Gradients, minimalist while being engaging.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    ![Mood Board](/images/bb-coin-branding/mood-board-1.png)\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n![Style Scape](/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-1.png)\n\n### Direction #2 - Pure minimalist, simple with flat colors.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Idea Mood Board</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    ![Mood Board](image-url)\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n![Style Scape](/images/bb-coin-branding/style-scape-2.png)\n\n### Direction #3 - Mix of both styles.\n\n![Style Scape](image-url)\n\n## Final Style Guide\n\nThe team decided to move forward with the second design direction, selecting the \"B\" logo mark for its simplicity and relevance. Building on this choice, I developed a comprehensive style guide to establish a strong foundation for the brand's visual identity.\n\n![Final Style Guide](image-url)\n\n## Website Design Mockup\n\n### Desktop Design\n\n![Desktop Design](image-url)\n\n### Mobile Design\n\n![Mobile Design](image-url)\n\n## Some Social Media Assets\n\n### Instagram Post Carousel\n\n![Instagram Carousel](image-url)\n\n### Addition of Patterns\n\nTo honor the heritage of the founders, I incorporated cultural patterns inspired by African and Caribbean traditions into the design, subtly weaving a rich tapestry of heritage into the brand's visual identity. I carefully melded these cultural elements with geometric shapes, ensuring a harmonious blend that enhances the existing design aesthetic.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mood Board - Cultural Patterns</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    ![Cultural Patterns](image-url)\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Mood Board - Geometric Patterns</summary>\n\n  <div style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>\n    ![Geometric Patterns](image-url)\n  </div>\n</details>\n\n![Final Patterns](image-url)\n\n### Retractable Banner\n\n![Retractable Banner](image-url)\n\n### Bounce Back Coin Animation\n\nAnimation illustrating the process of earning Bounce Back cryptocurrency upon completion of learning materials, crafted using Blender.\n\n![Animation](image-url)\n",
