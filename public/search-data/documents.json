    "content": "{/* <CardGrid>\r\n  <Note>\r\n    **Timeline**\\\r\n    January 2021 - April 2021\r\n  </Note>\r\n    <Note>\r\n    **Location**\\\r\n    University of Waterloo\r\n  </Note>\r\n    <Note>\r\n    **Team**\\\r\n    [Baber Ali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baber-ali-2ba9a9154/), [Saksham Tandon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/s9tandon/), [Youssef Bhagat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youssefbahgat/), [Ashutosh Khandelwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashutosh-khandelwal/), Sehyun Lim\r\n  </Note>\r\n  </CardGrid> */}\n\n## 💡 The Idea\n\nLynk began as a project focused on addressing the growing issue of **social isolation and its impact on mental and physical health**, particularly among young adults transitioning into new environments. We aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities.\n\n## 📝 Our Goal\n\n**Minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation** by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people.\n\n## 🎯 Our Focusing Themes\n\n<Tag>🤝 Connection</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧠 Mental Wellness</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📍 Local Activities</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🌱 Community Building</Tag>\n\n## ❓ The Core Problem\n\n## 🧠 My Roles\n\n<Tag>🔍 UX Research</Tag>\r\n<Tag>✨ Visual Design</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧪 Usability Testing</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📱 Prototyping</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📊 Business Analysis</Tag>\n\n## 📝 Our Solution\n\nLynk is an event organizing platform that helps people and small businesses organize and attend events in their vicinity. It is designed to reduce the stress and anxiety caused by social isolation by promoting real-world connections through local, wellness-oriented activities.\n\nThe app focuses on fostering safe, low-pressure social experiences that are easy to access and aligned with users’ emotional needs. By encouraging engagement in outdoor and group activities, the platform supports users in rebuilding routines, forming new relationships, and staying mentally and physically active.\n\n## 🔍 Initial Research and Insights\n\nWe started by looking into how young adults feel and act when they're socially isolated, especially during big life changes like moving for school or work. As young adults ourselves, we brought our first-hand experiences to the table, which helped us understand what is needed to feel supported, connected, and motivated to get involved in our communities again.\n\n### Target Audience\n\nBased on our initial research, we have identified our target market as individuals who are generally affected by poor mental health, with the following criteria:\n\n#### Target Audience Mood Board\n\nWe asked university students and working professionals from our target audience to share their thoughts and feelings about social isolation on an online mood board reflecting their experiences and highlighting their struggles during COVID-19.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-1.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-2.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-3.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n#### Summarized Insights\n\n### Competitive Landscape\n\nDuring our initial research, we also conducted market research to better understand our target market and their needs. We performed a competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities in the market.\n\n#### Competitors\n\n* **Meetup**: Focuses on group activities and has introduced a personalized event recommendation model to help members discover events aligned with their interests. However, it lacks a strong emphasis on emotional support and personalized experiences beyond event recommendations.\n\n* **Citysocializer and Nextdoor**: Offer local community engagement and help users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Citysocializer focuses on both in-person and virtual events, while Nextdoor is known for fostering a safe, friendly environment for neighborhood correspondence. However, these platforms do not specifically focus on emotional wellness.\n\n* **Eventbrite**: A popular event management platform that allows users to create, advertise, and sell tickets for events. It provides tools for event organizers to promote their events and reach a wider audience. Eventbrite's focus is more on logistics and event management rather than user care and emotional wellness.\n\n* **Wine For The People and Clozette**: Wine For The People offers wine tastings and events in an open, approachable setting, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity. Clozette, on the other hand, builds niche communities through lifestyle branding. Neither platform specifically addresses broader emotional needs or mental wellness.\n\n## 🔄 The Design Process\n\nOur design process was was split into 3 iterations, We began with a low-fidelity mockup to establish the foundation and layout of the application. Through user testing and feedback, we identified key areas for improvement, such as the need for a more minimalistic design and better emphasis on safety measures.\n\nIn the subsequent iterations, we developed high-fidelity prototypes, incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience and establish branding elements. Each iteration built upon the previous one, with a focus on refining the design and functionality of the platform based on user interactions and testing results.\n\n### Iteration 1: Foundation & Initial Feedback\n\nOur goal in iteration one was to create a solid foundation for our business idea, focusing on visual design, business, and user experience. We aimed to establish an understanding of our target audience and their needs, as well as the overall direction of our project.\n\n* **Iteration Highlights**:\n  * Conducted initial market research to identify the target audience and their needs.\n  * Mapped the User Flow and developed Low-Fidelity Prototypes for both web and mobile platforms to visualize the initial design concepts.\n  * Conducted Usability Testing and a Survey to gauge the reception of the idea and establish a basic application layout.\n\n#### User Flow\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/iteration-1-user-map.png\" alt=\"User Flow\" />\n\n#### Low Fidelity Prototype\n\n#### Usability Testing\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**:\n\n  * Users were tasked with two related activities while navigating through the prototype:\n    1. Logging into the app and signing up to attend an activity.\n    2. Creating an activity for others to attend.\n  * Users had the choice of interacting with either a desktop version or a mobile version, depending on their preferred device.\n</Note>\n\n**Findings**:\n\n* Users were mostly able to complete the tasks and navigate the mockup with relative ease.\n* Identified friction in completing tasks due to UX-related reasons, such as a lack of indicators for confirmation when joining an event.\n* Some users indicated that there was too much information being presented, making the whole experience overwhelming and distracting.\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **User Feedback**:\n\n    * One user mentioned, \"I'm not sure if it was just because it was a rough prototype, but the amount of information presented seemed a bit overwhelming to me. It took me aback at first and made me sort of pause before doing anything else.\"\n    * The idea received mixed receptions, with users indicating the need for more emphasis on safety and limitations during COVID-19. Another user commented, \"I guess my feedback is to try and focus on what value your app brings specifically. I guess I was expecting more attention to the whole COVID limitation part. To me, it just felt like a way to create events as normal.\"\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note type=\"warning\">\n    **Design Improvements**:\n\n    * Identified the need to provide information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way.\n    * Recognized the need to optimize button size and design, as some users found the buttons too small.\n    * Considered modifying the visual layout of the application to appear more modern and friendly, including changes to spacing between headings on the menu and the overall menu design.\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n### Iteration 2: Branding & High-Fidelity Development\n\nIn our second iteration, our main focus was to define the identity and characteristics of our user persona while establishing a strong brand through visual design. Additionally, we conducted another round of user testing for our mid-fidelity prototype.\n\n* **Iteration Highlights**:\n  * Establishing User Persona.\n  * Coming up with the branding and Mid-fidelty prototype in a minimalist style with feedback from previous iteration.\n  * Improving the User Flow for joining activities.\n  * Adding features like an attendee list to comply with COVID-19 gathering restrictions.\n\n#### User Persona\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note>\n    **Branding and Visual Design**:\n\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/branding.png\" alt=\"Lynk Branding\" />\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note>\n    **In-progress High Fidelity Mockup**:\n\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/mockup-iteration-2.png\" alt=\"Lynk Branding\" />\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n#### Improved User Flow for Joining Activities\n\nWe refined the user flow based on feedback from the first iteration, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the app to find and join activities.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/iteration-2-user-map.png\" alt=\"User Flow\" />\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/joining-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Joining Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/creating-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Creating Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n#### Adding List Attendees\n\nWith feedback from the first iteration, we added a feature to allow users to see who else is attending an activity and helping users gauge the density of crowd before signing up in concern for COVID-19. Users can also appear as anonymous to others if they choose to do so.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/attending-list.png\" alt=\"List Attendees\" />\n\n#### Usability Testing - 2\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**\n\n  * Users were asked to perform the following tasks:\n    1. Sign up for the app.\n    2. Create an activity for others to join.\n</Note>\n\n#### Findings\n\n* Users provided very positive responses on the visual aspects of the app.\n* However, users still had difficulties finding where to create and sign up for an activity.\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **Learnings from User Feedback**:\n\n    * The amount of information presented was overwhelming for some users, causing hesitation.\n    * Users found it hard to differentiate between types of buttons.\n    * There was confusion about the relevance of the company name and motto.\n    * Clarity in wording is crucial, as some users found certain phrases confusing.\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note type=\"warning\">\n    **Improvements to be Made**:\n\n    * Adopt a more minimalistic and user-friendly information presentation.\n    * Optimize buttons and design for better flow and better differentiation for different actions.\n    * Replace the company name and motto with a logo to save screen space.\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n### Iteration 3: UX Testing & Interaction Refinement\n\nOur focus in iteration three was to improve the usability of key user flows based on feedback, especially the process of creating an activity. We tested a more complete desktop prototype and used structured feedback to guide design revisions.\n\n* **Iteration Highlights**:\n  * Conducted one-on-one usability testing with participants using the high-fidelity desktop prototype.\n  * Used Kano Model survey to assess feature expectations and categorize them by priority.\n  * Focused testing on how users navigated and interacted with the \"Create Activity\" flow.\n\n#### Improved Creating Activity Flow\n\nSplit the activity creation flow into multiple pages to make the information easier for users to understand and complete.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/iteration-3-user-map.png\" alt=\"User Flow for Creating Activities\" />\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/expanded-creating-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Improved Creating Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n#### Kano Model Survey\n\n#### Usability Testing - 3\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**:\n\n  * Create an account.\n  * Explore and join an activity.\n  * Create a new activity using the full creation flow.\n</Note>\n\n**Findings**:\n\n* Users were confused by the number of steps required to create an activity.\n* The lack of visual cues and guidance during form-filling led to hesitation.\n* Several users struggled with horizontal scrolling, which disrupted the flow.\n* Some UI elements lacked context, resulting in questions like \"What does this button do?\"\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **User Feedback**:\n\n    * “I wasn’t sure if I completed the activity creation process properly. It needs more guidance.”\n    * “There’s a lot going on in the form. Not sure where to start or what’s important.”\n    * Improve the Google Analytics linking page.\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note type=\"warning\">\n    **Design Improvements**:\n\n    * Simplify the activity creation flow by reducing input fields and grouping them logically.\n    * Replace horizontal scrolling with vertical sections for better clarity.\n    * Add contextual indicators (e.g., tooltips, inline hints) to improve comprehension.\n    * Defered the Google Analytics feature to be added after release with more refinement.\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n### Observations from directly observing users\n\nBecause of the low turnout of participants from the survey, we decided to conduct a moderated usability test with another 2 participants on video-call. We observed them as they navigated through the prototype and took notes on their interactions. This provided us with valuable insights into their thought processes and decision-making.\n\n### Final Changes before MVP\n\n#### Updating the Navbar from Vertical to Horizontal\n\nNoting from the final feedback, to improve navigation, we switched the navbar to a horizontal layout with labels visible to give users a clearer understanding of the different sections of the app.\n\n#### Adding breadcrumbs to the activity creation process\n\nAfter receiveing feedback from users, we added breadcrumbs to the activity creation process to help users understand their current step within the activity creation step and added a back button with label to navigate back to previous steps easily.\n\n#### Payment Processor Pop-Up\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/pay-popup-after.png\" alt=\"Payment Popup\" />\n\n#### Adding tooltip information for explaining tags\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/tooltip-after.png\" alt=\"Tag Tooltip\" />\n\n## 🏆 Final Prototype\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/lynk-hero-showcase.png\" alt=\"Hero\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/user-flow-final.png\" alt=\"Final User Flow\" />\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/final-prototype.png\" alt=\"Final Prototype\" />\n\n### Final Presentation\n\n[View the full presentation of the project on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tOqagJp08)\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7tOqagJp08\" title=\"Lynk Full Presentation\" />\n",

as a project focused on addressing the growing issue of social isolation and its impact on mental and physical health particularly among young adults transitioning into new environments we aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities our goal minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people our focusing themes tag connection tag tag mental wellness tag tag local activities tag tag community building tag the core problem my roles tag ux research tag tag visual design tag tag usability testing tag tag prototyping tag tag business analysis tag our solution lynk is an event organizing platform that helps people and small businesses organize and attend events in their vicinity it is designed to reduce the stress and anxiety caused by social isolation by promoting real-world connections through local wellness-oriented activities the app focuses on fostering safe low-pressure social experiences that are easy to access and aligned with users emotional needs by encouraging engagement in outdoor and group activities the platform supports users in rebuilding routines forming new relationships and staying mentally and physically active initial research and insights we started by looking into how young adults feel and act when they re socially isolated especially during big life changes like moving for school or work as young adults ourselves we brought our first-hand experiences to the table which helped us understand what is needed to feel supported connected and motivated to get involved in our communities again target audience based on our initial research we have identified our target market as individuals who are generally affected by poor mental health with the following criteria: target audience mood board we asked university students and working professionals from our target audience to share their thoughts and feelings about social isolation on an online mood board reflecting their experiences and highlighting their struggles during covid-19 imageviewer imageurl images

market and their needs we performed a competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities in the market competitors meetup: focuses on group activities and has introduced a personalized event recommendation model to help members discover events aligned with their interests however it lacks a strong emphasis on emotional support and personalized experiences beyond event recommendations citysocializer and nextdoor: offer local community engagement and help users connect with neighbors and local businesses citysocializer focuses on both in-person and virtual events while nextdoor is known for fostering a safe friendly environment for neighborhood correspondence however these platforms do not specifically focus on emotional wellness eventbrite: a popular event management platform that allows users to create advertise and sell tickets for events it provides tools for event organizers to promote their events and reach a wider audience eventbrite s focus is more on logistics and event management rather than user care and emotional wellness wine for the people and clozette: wine for the people offers wine tastings and events in an open approachable setting fostering a sense of community and inclusivity clozette on the other hand builds niche communities through lifestyle branding neither platform specifically addresses broader emotional needs or mental wellness the design
