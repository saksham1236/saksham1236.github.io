I conduct thorough user research and testing to enhance user experiences and drive conversion rates. A notable achievement includes contributing to a 193% increase in Research Hub article views and a 93% boost in partner page traffic through strategic content planning and implementation.\n\nAdditionally, as a Scientific Illustrator, I collaborate with researchers to produce illustrations and animations featured on covers and supplementary materials in scientific papers and journals. Notably, I designed a journal cover for Biophysical Journal showcasing the experimental setup and structure of pulmonary surfactants.\n\nHaving completed my Software Engineering Bootcamp at BrainStation, where I gained proficiency in coding and web application development, I am now expanding my expertise in data science. I am currently learning Python for data analysis, machine learning techniques, and data visualization. This knowledge empowers me to integrate statistical analysis and predictive modeling into innovative digital solutions.\n\n***\n\n## 🧬 My Journey\n\n* 🎓 BA in **Global Business and Digital Arts** (University of Waterloo)\n* 🧪 Created journal cover art and scientific illustrations for research publications\n* 💻 Completed a **Software Engineering Bootcamp** at BrainStation\n* 📊 Currently pursuing a **MicroMasters in Data Science** through MITx\n\n***\n\n## 🛠 Tools I Use\n\n### 🧠 Data Science & Machine Learning\n\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--python.svg\" alt=\"Python\" width={32} height={32} />Python</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--pandas-icon.svg\" alt=\"Pandas\" width={32} height={32} />Pandas</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--numpy.svg\" alt=\"NumPy\" width={32} height={32} />NumPy</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--scikit-learn.png\" alt=\"Scikit-learn\" width={32} height={32} />Scikit-learn</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--pytorch-icon.svg\" alt=\"PyTorch\" width={32} height={32} />PyTorch</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--matplotlib-icon.svg\" alt=\"Matplotlib\" width={32} height={32} />Matplotlib</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--seaborn-icon.svg\" alt=\"Seaborn\" width={32} height={32} />Seaborn</Tag>\n\n### 💻 Programming & Web Development\n\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--javascript.svg\" alt=\"JavaScript\" width={32} height={32} />JavaScript</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--typescript-icon.svg\" alt=\"TypeScript\" width={32} height={32} />TypeScript</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--react.svg\" alt=\"React\" width={32} height={32} />React</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--nodejs-icon.svg\" alt=\"Node.js\" width={32} height={32} />Node.js</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--express.svg\" alt=\"Express\" width={32} height={32} />Express</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--nextjs-icon.svg\" alt=\"HTML\" width={32} height={32} />Next.Js</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--sass.svg\" alt=\"SASS\" width={32} height={32} />SASS</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--mysql-icon.svg\" alt=\"MySQL\" width={32} height={32} />MySQL</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--jest.svg\" alt=\"Jest\" width={32} height={32} />Jest</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--supabase-icon.svg\" alt=\"Supabase\" width={32} height={32} />Supabase</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--git-icon.svg\" alt=\"Git\" width={32} height={32} />Git</Tag>\n\n### 🎨 Design & Creative Tools\n\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--figma.svg\" alt=\"Figma\" width={32} height={32} />Figma</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--adobe-photoshop.svg\" alt=\"Photoshop\" width={32} height={32} />Photoshop</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--adobe-illustrator.svg\" alt=\"Illustrator\" width={32} height={32} />Illustrator</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--adobe-after-effects.svg\" alt=\"After Effects\" width={32} height={32} />After Effects</Tag>\r\n<Tag><Image src=\"/images/about/logos/logos--blender.svg\" alt=\"Blender\" width={32} height={32} />Blender</Tag>\n\n***\n\n## 🕹 Beyond the Screen\n\nWhen I’m not designing or coding, I’m:\n\n* 🧗 Practioning parkour **parkour**\n* 💃 Dancing **salsa and bachata**\n* 🧠 Studying **AI, data science**, and tech ethics\n* 🎮 Getting inspired by **video games** and digital art\n\n***\n",

    "content": "<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-learning/hero.png\" alt=\"Bounce Back Learning App - Hero\" className=\"aspect-[32/9]\" />\n\n## 📝 Summary\n\nBounce Back Coin Learning Platform was a learning management system (LMS) that aimed to combine education with cryptocurrency incentives. The platform allowed users to earn crypto by watching educational videos and completing quizzes, encouraging continued learning through direct rewards. It offered a range of content, focusing on STEM subjects such as coding, mathematics, and science, as well as language learning.\n\nThe system included course-specific discussion threads to support peer interaction and community learning. Users could also manage their earned crypto through a built-in wallet dashboard. Although the startup is now defunct, the platform represented an experimental approach to blending decentralized finance and education.\n\n## 🛠️ What did I do?\n\n<Tag>Visual Design</Tag><Tag>High Fidelity Prototype</Tag><Tag>Design System</Tag>\n\n## 🧩 The Problem\n\n### A Novelty Product\n\nThe challenge was to design a complex learning system that combined education, cryptocurrency, and game-like elements into a single experience that felt fun, rewarding, and motivating.\n\n### Bringing Education, Crypto, and Play under One App\n\nMost LMS platforms only deliver content, but Bounce Back aimed to create an ecosystem where learning progress translated directly into tangible rewards and community interaction. This meant going far beyond courses — integrating a wallet, reward mechanisms, gamified quizzes, and peer discussions, all under one consistent design system that could scale as the product grew.\n\n## 🚀 The Solution\n\n### What was present\n\nWhile I was developing the branding, the co-founders had already started sketching their own ideas, which helped me understand their vision.\n\n<CarouselView>\n  <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-learning/starter-02.png\" alt=\"Bounce Back Learning - Initial Ideas\" />\n\n  <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/bb-learning/starter-04.png\" alt=\"Bounce Back Learning - Initial Ideas\" />\n</CarouselView>\n\n### First Steps - The Bounce Back Design System\n\nTo tackle the complexity of the platform, I began by creating what was less a design system and more a component library that could be reused anywhere in the app. It started with simple primitives like buttons, cards, text fields, and forms, but then expanded to include more advanced elements such as charts, replies, audio player, toolbars, and even a code editor.\n\n### Initial Designs\n\n\"In the initial design phases, there was little time for exploration, but here’s a snippet from the early idea for the dashboard. I wish I had the time to document the rest of the process. Funny enough, most of the feedback was just 'a certain feature is missing' or 'make it nicer.' (I even paid for Figma Professional to get this screenshot 😩)\"\n\n### Final Product and Learnings\n\nThe final product brought together all parts of the platform into a single experience — courses, quizzes, rewards, wallet management, and peer-to-peer discussions. Working alongside another designer while managing other initiatives, delivering an MVP was a race against time. This experience taught me how to prioritize features effectively and decide what to defer under tight deadlines.\n\n* **A Design System? A Component Library?** As I built more and collaborated with developers, it became clearer — this was a component library with a style guide. A true design system would have included more thorough documentation, better reasoning for decisions, and would have made the developer’s job easier, reducing the need for assumptions about how or where to use a component.\n* **Designing for others.** This was my first time building a system where I had to think beyond my own use of components — considering how other designers would use them and how the system would need to scale as the project’s scope grew.

    "content": "<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/lynk-hero-showcase.png\" alt=\"Lynk - Hero\" title=\"Hero showcase\" className=\"aspect-[32/9]\" />\n\n## 📝 Summary\n\nLynk was a social platform designed to reduce isolation among young adults by making it easier to connect with local communities, organize activities, and attend events. The project was based on the insight that individuals entering new environments — whether school, work, or a new city — often struggled to build meaningful connections, which negatively affected their mental and physical health.\n\nThe app’s main features allowed users to create or join communities, host events, and participate in activities that matched their interests. Users could browse local groups, view attendee lists before committing, and take part in activities that encouraged healthier routines.\n\nThe product went through three rounds of usability testing and iterative refinement. Updates included simplifying event creation flows, adding breadcrumbs and horizontal navigation, incorporating COVID-safety considerations, refining the visual hierarchy, and implementing payment and confirmation pop-ups to reduce uncertainty.\n\nBy its final iteration, Lynk enabled users to engage with local communities in a structured and supportive way, making it easier to attend events and form connections in new environments.\n\n## 🛠️ What did I do?\n\n<Tag>UX Research</Tag>\r\n<Tag>User Flows</Tag>\r\n<Tag>Usability Testing</Tag>\r\n<Tag>Interaction Design</Tag>\r\n<Tag>High-Fidelity Prototype</Tag>\r\n<Tag>Business Analysis</Tag>\r\n<Tag>Product Strategy</Tag>\n\n## 🧩 The Problem\n\n### Key Gaps in Existing Platforms\n\nWhile platforms like Meetup, Eventbrite, and Nextdoor help users connect in different ways, they don’t fully address the emotional readiness, mental health, and accessibility needs of young adults facing social isolation. This revealed a clear gap: users need a platform that reduces social friction, supports emotional well-being, and encourages a gentle return to social life, especially after long periods of isolation.\n\n## 🚀 The Solution\n\n### Building a Safe and Supportive Platform\n\nTo tackle the challenges of social isolation, Lynk was designed as an event organizing platform that fosters real-world connections. The focus was on creating low-pressure, emotionally supportive experiences, enabling users to safely participate in local activities while rebuilding routines and forming new social bonds. Wellness-oriented, outdoor, and group activities were prioritized to promote both mental and physical health, with features like activity categorization, attendee lists, and optional anonymity giving users control over their social interactions.\n\n### The Approach\n\nLynk’s design followed an iterative, three-iteration process, improving with feedback from each stage to create a platform that supports social connections and emotional well-being.\n\n<div className=\"py-8\">\n  <CardGrid className=\"lg:!grid-cols-2 gap-16 prose-p:!mb-0 prose-headings:!mt-0 items-center py-8\">\n    <div>\n      ### Building the Community: Mid-Fidelity and Branding\n\n      In the second iteration, we developed mid-fidelity prototypes with defined branding and a clear user flow for joining activities. Features like an attendee list addressed COVID-19 safety concerns, while user feedback guided improvements to button design, layout, and navigation clarity.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"flex max-h-full\">\n      <VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/joining-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Joining Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n    </div>\n  </CardGrid>\n\n  <CarouselView aspect=\"aspect-video h-full\">\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/branding.png\" alt=\"Lynk Branding\" title=\"Branding\" />\n\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/mockup-iteration-2.png\" alt=\"Lynk Midfidelity\" title=\"Mid-fidelity mockup\" />\n\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/attending-list.png\" alt=\"List Attendees\" title=\"Attendee list\" />\n  </CarouselView>\n</div>\n\n<CardGrid className=\"!grid-cols-1 gap-16 prose-p:!mb-0 prose-headings:!mt-0 items-center py-8\">\n  <div>\n    ### Final Steps: Preparing for MVP\n\n    In the final iteration, we implemented last refinements before the MVP release. This included updating the navbar layout to horizontal, adding breadcrumbs for multi-step flows, clarifying tooltips and tag information, and improving the payment confirmation pop-up.\n  </div>\n\n  <div className=\"flex max-h-full\">\n    <CarouselView aspect=\"aspect-auto h-full\">\n      <ImageViewer className=\"!aspect-square\" imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/nav-after.png\" alt=\"Navbar Horizontal\" title=\"Navbar (after)\" />\n\n      <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/breadcrumbs-after.png\" alt=\"breadcrumbs-after\" title=\"Breadcrumbs (after)\" />\n\n      <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/pay-popup-after.png\" alt=\"Payment Popup\" title=\"Payment popup\" />\n\n      <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/tooltip-after.png\" alt=\"Tag Tooltip\" title=\"Tag tooltip\" />\n    </CarouselView>\n  </div>\n</CardGrid>\n\n## Final Product and Key Learnings\n\nThis was my second experience taking a product design idea from a problem statement to a business concept and then to an MVP. It was a valuable opportunity to strengthen my design skills, learn how to prioritize features, and refine user flows based on real feedback. Here is what I learned.\n\n* **Bringing it all together:** The final prototype brought together all aspects of the platform — joining and creating activities, attendee lists, tooltips, breadcrumbs, payment pop-ups, and the hero screen. Iteratively refining each element while responding to user feedback taught me how to prioritize features, decide what could be deferred, and continuously improve usability and support for emotional well-being.\n\n* **Designing for clarity:** Early testing revealed that too much information and unclear navigation overwhelmed users. This experience reinforced the importance of step-by-step guidance, intuitive layouts, and clear visual cues to help users confidently engage with the platform.\n\n* **Safety and trust:** Features like anonymous participation and attendee lists were essential for user comfort, particularly during COVID-19. Incorporating these considerations taught me how design decisions impact user trust and emotional well-being.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/final-prototype.png\" alt=\"Final Prototype\" title=\"Final prototype\" />\n\n[Read the full Lynk case study here](/docs/recent-work/lynk/lynk-full)\n",

    "content": "## 💡 The Idea\n\nLynk began as a project focused on addressing the growing issue of **social isolation and its impact on mental and physical health**, particularly among young adults transitioning into new environments. We aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities.\n\n## 📝 Our Goal\n\n**Minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation** by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people.\n\n## 🎯 Our Focusing Themes\n\n<Tag>🤝 Connection</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧠 Mental Wellness</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📍 Local Activities</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🌱 Community Building</Tag>\n\n## ❓ The Core Problem\n\n## 🧠 My Roles\n\n<Tag>🔍 UX Research</Tag>\r\n<Tag>✨ Visual Design</Tag>\r\n<Tag>🧪 Usability Testing</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📱 Prototyping</Tag>\r\n<Tag>📊 Business Analysis</Tag>\n\n## 📝 Our Solution\n\nLynk is an event organizing platform that helps people and small businesses organize and attend events in their vicinity. It is designed to reduce the stress and anxiety caused by social isolation by promoting real-world connections through local, wellness-oriented activities.\n\nThe app focuses on fostering safe, low-pressure social experiences that are easy to access and aligned with users’ emotional needs. By encouraging engagement in outdoor and group activities, the platform supports users in rebuilding routines, forming new relationships, and staying mentally and physically active.\n\n## 🔍 Initial Research and Insights\n\nWe started by looking into how young adults feel and act when they're socially isolated, especially during big life changes like moving for school or work. As young adults ourselves, we brought our first-hand experiences to the table, which helped us understand what is needed to feel supported, connected, and motivated to get involved in our communities again.\n\n### Target Audience\n\nBased on our initial research, we have identified our target market as individuals who are generally affected by poor mental health, with the following criteria:\n\n#### Target Audience Mood Board\n\nWe asked university students and working professionals from our target audience to share their thoughts and feelings about social isolation on an online mood board reflecting their experiences and highlighting their struggles during COVID-19.\n\n<ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/target-audience-mood-board-2.jpg\" alt=\"Target Audience Mood Board\" />\n\n#### Summarized Insights\n\n### Competitive Landscape\n\nDuring our initial research, we also conducted market research to better understand our target market and their needs. We performed a competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities in the market.\n\n#### Competitors\n\n* **Meetup**: Focuses on group activities and has introduced a personalized event recommendation model to help members discover events aligned with their interests. However, it lacks a strong emphasis on emotional support and personalized experiences beyond event recommendations.\n\n* **Citysocializer and Nextdoor**: Offer local community engagement and help users connect with neighbors and local businesses. Citysocializer focuses on both in-person and virtual events, while Nextdoor is known for fostering a safe, friendly environment for neighborhood correspondence. However, these platforms do not specifically focus on emotional wellness.\n\n* **Eventbrite**: A popular event management platform that allows users to create, advertise, and sell tickets for events. It provides tools for event organizers to promote their events and reach a wider audience. Eventbrite's focus is more on logistics and event management rather than user care and emotional wellness.\n\n* **Wine For The People and Clozette**: Wine For The People offers wine tastings and events in an open, approachable setting, fostering a sense of community and inclusivity. Clozette, on the other hand, builds niche communities through lifestyle branding. Neither platform specifically addresses broader emotional needs or mental wellness.\n\n## 🔄 The Design Process\n\nOur design process was was split into 3 iterations, We began with a low-fidelity mockup to establish the foundation and layout of the application. Through user testing and feedback, we identified key areas for improvement, such as the need for a more minimalistic design and better emphasis on safety measures.\n\nIn the subsequent iterations, we developed high-fidelity prototypes, incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience and establish branding elements. Each iteration built upon the previous one, with a focus on refining the design and functionality of the platform based on user interactions and testing results.\n\n### Iteration 1: Foundation & Initial Feedback\n\nOur goal in iteration one was to create a solid foundation for our business idea, focusing on visual design, business, and user experience. We aimed to establish an understanding of our target audience and their needs, as well as the overall direction of our project.\n\n* **Iteration Highlights**:\n  * Conducted initial market research to identify the target audience and their needs.\n  * Mapped the User Flow and developed Low-Fidelity Prototypes for both web and mobile platforms to visualize the initial design concepts.\n  * Conducted Usability Testing and a Survey to gauge the reception of the idea and establish a basic application layout.\n\n#### User Flow\n\n#### Low Fidelity Prototype\n\n#### Usability Testing\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**:\n\n  * Users were tasked with two related activities while navigating through the prototype:\n    1. Logging into the app and signing up to attend an activity.\n    2. Creating an activity for others to attend.\n  * Users had the choice of interacting with either a desktop version or a mobile version, depending on their preferred device.\n</Note>\n\n**Findings**:\n\n* Users were mostly able to complete the tasks and navigate the mockup with relative ease.\n* Identified friction in completing tasks due to UX-related reasons, such as a lack of indicators for confirmation when joining an event.\n* Some users indicated that there was too much information being presented, making the whole experience overwhelming and distracting.\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **User Feedback**:\n\n    * One user mentioned, \"I'm not sure if it was just because it was a rough prototype, but the amount of information presented seemed a bit overwhelming to me. It took me aback at first and made me sort of pause before doing anything else.\"\n    * The idea received mixed receptions, with users indicating the need for more emphasis on safety and limitations during COVID-19. Another user commented, \"I guess my feedback is to try and focus on what value your app brings specifically. I guess I was expecting more attention to the whole COVID limitation part. To me, it just felt like a way to create events as normal.\"\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note type=\"warning\">\n    **Design Improvements**:\n\n    * Identified the need to provide information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way.\n    * Recognized the need to optimize button size and design, as some users found the buttons too small.\n    * Considered modifying the visual layout of the application to appear more modern and friendly, including changes to spacing between headings on the menu and the overall menu design.\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n### Iteration 2: Branding & High-Fidelity Development\n\nIn our second iteration, our main focus was to define the identity and characteristics of our user persona while establishing a strong brand through visual design. Additionally, we conducted another round of user testing for our mid-fidelity prototype.\n\n* **Iteration Highlights**:\n  * Establishing User Persona.\n  * Coming up with the branding and Mid-fidelty prototype in a minimalist style with feedback from previous iteration.\n  * Improving the User Flow for joining activities.\n  * Adding features like an attendee list to comply with COVID-19 gathering restrictions.\n\n#### User Persona\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note>\n    **Branding and Visual Design**:\n\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/branding.png\" alt=\"Lynk Branding\" />\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note>\n    **In-progress High Fidelity Mockup**:\n\n    <ImageViewer imageUrl=\"/images/lynk/mockup-iteration-2.png\" alt=\"Lynk Branding\" />\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n#### Improved User Flow for Joining Activities\n\nWe refined the user flow based on feedback from the first iteration, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the app to find and join activities.\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/joining-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Joining Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/creating-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Creating Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n#### Adding List Attendees\n\nWith feedback from the first iteration, we added a feature to allow users to see who else is attending an activity and helping users gauge the density of crowd before signing up in concern for COVID-19. Users can also appear as anonymous to others if they choose to do so.\n\n#### Usability Testing - 2\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**\n\n  * Users were asked to perform the following tasks:\n    1. Sign up for the app.\n    2. Create an activity for others to join.\n</Note>\n\n#### Findings\n\n* Users provided very positive responses on the visual aspects of the app.\n* However, users still had difficulties finding where to create and sign up for an activity.\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **Learnings from User Feedback**:\n\n    * The amount of information presented was overwhelming for some users, causing hesitation.\n    * Users found it hard to differentiate between types of buttons.\n    * There was confusion about the relevance of the company name and motto.\n    * Clarity in wording is crucial, as some users found certain phrases confusing.\n  </Note>\n\n  <Note type=\"warning\">\n    **Improvements to be Made**:\n\n    * Adopt a more minimalistic and user-friendly information presentation.\n    * Optimize buttons and design for better flow and better differentiation for different actions.\n    * Replace the company name and motto with a logo to save screen space.\n  </Note>\n</CardGrid>\n\n### Iteration 3: UX Testing & Interaction Refinement\n\nOur focus in iteration three was to improve the usability of key user flows based on feedback, especially the process of creating an activity. We tested a more complete desktop prototype and used structured feedback to guide design revisions.\n\n* **Iteration Highlights**:\n  * Conducted one-on-one usability testing with participants using the high-fidelity desktop prototype.\n  * Used Kano Model survey to assess feature expectations and categorize them by priority.\n  * Focused testing on how users navigated and interacted with the \"Create Activity\" flow.\n\n#### Improved Creating Activity Flow\n\nSplit the activity creation flow into multiple pages to make the information easier for users to understand and complete.\n\n<VideoPlayer src=\"/images/lynk/expanded-creating-activity-workflow.mp4\" title=\"Improved Creating Activities Preview\" autoplay={true} loop={true} />\n\n#### Kano Model Survey\n\n#### Usability Testing - 3\n\n<Note>\n  **User Tasks**:\n\n  * Create an account.\n  * Explore and join an activity.\n  * Create a new activity using the full creation flow.\n</Note>\n\n**Findings**:\n\n* Users were confused by the number of steps required to create an activity.\n* The lack of visual cues and guidance during form-filling led to hesitation.\n* Several users struggled with horizontal scrolling, which disrupted the flow.\n* Some UI elements lacked context, resulting in questions like \"What does this button do?\"\n\n<CardGrid className=\"xl:!grid-cols-2\">\n  <Note type=\"info\">\n    **User Feedback**:\n\n    * “I wasn’t sure if I completed the activity creation process properly. It needs more guidance.”\n    * “There’s a lot going on in the form.

      "cleanContent": "the idea lynk began as a project focused on addressing the growing issue of social isolation and its impact on mental and physical health particularly among young adults transitioning into new environments we aimed to create a platform that fosters real-world connections through shared activities our goal minimize the stress and anxiety resulting from prolonged social isolation by providing a seamless way for individuals to find and participate in nearby activities and meet new people our focusing themes tag connection tag tag mental wellness tag tag local activities tag tag community building tag the core problem my roles tag ux research tag tag visual design tag tag usability testing tag tag prototyping tag tag business analysis tag our solution lynk is an event organizing platform that helps people and small businesses organize and attend events in their vicinity it is designed to reduce the stress and anxiety caused by social isolation by promoting real-world connections through local wellness-oriented activities the app focuses on fostering safe low-pressure social experiences that are easy to access and aligned with users emotional needs by encouraging engagement in outdoor and group activities the platform supports users in rebuilding routines forming new relationships and staying mentally and physically active initial research and insights we started by looking into how young adults feel and act when they re socially isolated especially during big life changes like moving for school or work as young adults ourselves we brought our first-hand experiences to the table which helped us understand what is needed to feel supported connected and motivated to get involved in our communities again target audience based on our initial research we have identified our target market as individuals who are generally affected by poor mental health with the following criteria: target audience mood board we asked university students and working professionals from our target audience to share their thoughts and feelings about social isolation on an online mood board reflecting their experiences and highlighting their struggles during covid-19 imageviewer imageurl images lynk target-audience-mood-board-2 jpg alt target audience mood board summarized insights competitive landscape during our initial research we also conducted market research to better understand our target market and their needs we performed a competitive analysis to identify gaps and opportunities in the market competitors meetup: focuses on group activities and has introduced a personalized event recommendation model to help members discover events aligned with their interests however it lacks a strong emphasis on emotional support and personalized experiences beyond event recommendations citysocializer and nextdoor: offer local community engagement and help users connect with neighbors and local businesses citysocializer focuses on both in-person and virtual events while nextdoor is known for fostering a safe friendly environment for neighborhood correspondence however these platforms do not specifically focus on emotional wellness eventbrite: a popular event management platform that allows users to create advertise and sell tickets for events it provides tools for event organizers to promote their events and reach a wider audience eventbrite s focus is more on logistics and event management rather than user care and emotional wellness wine for the people and clozette: wine for the people offers wine tastings and events in an open approachable setting fostering a sense of community and inclusivity clozette on the other hand builds niche communities through lifestyle branding neither platform specifically addresses broader emotional needs or mental wellness the design process our design process was was split into 3 iterations we began with a low-fidelity mockup to establish the foundation and layout of the application through user testing and feedback we identified key areas for improvement such as the need for a more minimalistic design and better emphasis on safety measures in the subsequent iterations we developed high-fidelity prototypes incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience and establish branding elements each iteration built upon the previous one with a focus on refining the design and functionality of the platform based on user interactions and testing results iteration 1: foundation initial feedback our goal in iteration one was to create a solid foundation for our business idea focusing on visual design business and user experience we aimed to establish an understanding of our target audience and their needs as well as the overall direction of our project iteration highlights: conducted initial market research to identify the target audience and their needs mapped the user flow and developed low-fidelity prototypes for both web and mobile platforms to visualize the initial design concepts conducted usability testing and a survey to gauge the reception of the idea and establish a basic application layout user flow low fidelity prototype usability testing user tasks: users were tasked with two related activities while navigating through the prototype: logging into the app and signing up to attend an activity creating an activity for others to attend users had the choice of interacting with either a desktop version or a mobile version depending on their preferred device findings: users were mostly able to complete the tasks and navigate the mockup with relative ease identified friction in completing tasks due to ux-related reasons such as a lack of indicators for confirmation when joining an event some users indicated that there was too much information being presented making the whole experience overwhelming and distracting note type info user feedback: one user mentioned i m not sure if it was just because it was a rough prototype but the amount of information presented seemed a bit overwhelming to me it took me aback at first and made me sort of pause before doing anything else the idea received mixed receptions with users indicating the need for more emphasis on safety and limitations during covid-19 another user commented i guess my feedback is to try and focus on what value your app brings specifically i guess i was expecting more attention to the whole covid limitation part to me it just felt like a way to create events as normal design improvements: identified the need to provide information in a more minimalistic and user-friendly way recognized the need to optimize button size and design as some users found the buttons too small considered modifying the visual layout of the application to appear more modern and friendly including changes to spacing between headings on the menu and the overall menu design cardgrid iteration 2: branding high-fidelity development in our second iteration our main focus was to define the identity and characteristics of our user persona while establishing a strong brand through visual design additionally we conducted another round of user testing for our mid-fidelity prototype iteration highlights: establishing user persona coming up with the branding and mid-fidelty prototype in a minimalist style with feedback from previous iteration improving the user flow for joining activities adding features like an attendee list to comply with covid-19 gathering restrictions user persona note branding and visual design: imageviewer

activities we refined the user flow based on feedback from the first iteration ensuring that users can easily navigate through the app to find and join activities videoplayer src images lynk

true adding list attendees with feedback from the first iteration we added a feature to allow users to see who else is attending an activity and helping users gauge the density of crowd before signing up in concern for covid-19 users can also appear as anonymous to others if they choose to do so usability testing - 2 user tasks users were asked to perform the following tasks: sign up for the app create an activity for others to join findings users provided very positive responses on the visual aspects of the app however users still had difficulties finding where to create and sign up for an activity note type info learnings from user feedback: the amount of information presented was overwhelming for some users causing hesitation users found it hard to differentiate between types of buttons there was confusion about the relevance of the company name and motto clarity in wording is crucial as some users found certain phrases confusing improvements to be made: adopt a more minimalistic and user-friendly information presentation optimize buttons and design for better flow and better differentiation for different actions replace the company name and motto with a logo to save screen space cardgrid iteration 3: ux testing interaction refinement our focus in iteration three was to improve the usability of key user flows based on feedback especially the process of creating an activity we tested a more complete desktop prototype and used structured feedback to guide design revisions iteration highlights: conducted one-on-one usability testing with participants using the high-fidelity desktop prototype used kano model survey to assess feature expectations and categorize them by priority focused testing on how users navigated and interacted with the create activity flow improved creating activity flow split the activity creation flow into multiple pages to make the information easier for users to understand and complete videoplayer src images lynk expanded-creating-activity-workflow mp4 title improved creating activities preview autoplay true loop true kano model survey usability testing - 3 user tasks: create an account explore and join an activity create a new activity using the full creation flow findings: users were confused by the number of steps required to create an activity the lack of visual cues and guidance during form-filling led to hesitation several users struggled with horizontal scrolling which disrupted the flow some ui elements lacked context resulting in questions like what does this button do note type info user feedback: i wasn t sure if i completed the activity creation process properly it needs more guidance there s a lot going on in the form not sure where to start or what s important improve the google analytics linking page design improvements: simplify the activity creation flow by reducing input fields and grouping them logically replace horizontal scrolling with vertical sections for better clarity add contextual indicators e g tooltips inline hints to improve comprehension defered the google analytics feature to be added after release with more refinement cardgrid observations from directly observing users because of the low turnout of participants from the survey we decided to conduct a moderated usability test with another 2 participants on video-call we observed them as they navigated through the prototype and took notes on their interactions this provided us with valuable insights into their thought processes and decision-making final changes before mvp updating the navbar from vertical to horizontal noting from the final feedback to improve navigation we switched the navbar to a horizontal layout with labels visible to give users a clearer understanding of the different sections of the app adding breadcrumbs to the activity creation process after receiveing feedback from users we added breadcrumbs to the activity creation process to help users understand their current step within the activity creation step and added a back button with label to navigate back to previous steps easily payment processor pop-up adding tooltip information for explaining
